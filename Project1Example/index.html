                Sharksidon is a large aquatic mammal belonging to class Chondrichthyes. It is one of the tallest aquatic animals. Sharksidon is one of three brothers who wields magical powers. Unfortunately, anger issues run in his family bloodline and he usually takes his rage out of the fish around him. Sometimes, if he gets angry, he starts to flood villages on land though.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Sharksidon enjoys swimming on the ocean floor with little interuption, unless you prevent him with a fish! When gifting him a fish, he'll become extremely happy and flustered but will quickly become angry if you poke him; Thus resulting in lightning bolts spawning around him.
